USACO 2014-2015 CONTEST 1
==

December 15. This was my first programming competition, so it was time to put my skills to the test.

Before the contest, I was debating between Python and Java. Ultimately I decided to use Python because of the more beautiful syntax, and simply because I know more Python than Java. Also, there are more convenient methods built into Python.

I started the contest (can't remember when exactly). After looking at #1, I had a good idea on how to solve it; just consider every case skipping a checkpoint and sum up the distances for the rest! I coded this within 20 minutes, and submitted it. However, I was shocked to see that the program timed out for over half the cases! Disappointed, I struggled for another 10 minutes to find a faster solution. I soon came across a better one: find the total sum and then subtract the ones you don't need for a case. Fortunately, this worked for all the test cases. 1 down, 3 to go in a little over 3 hours.

I then proceeded to look at #2. This wasn't terribly bad, I thought. Coded the program for half an hour, then submitted. Crap, I thought, it didn't work for everything. Why? I attempted to waste 30 minutes trying to debug my solution. Alas, I gave up and moved onto #3.

#3, if anything, was easier than #2. You don't even need the positions, just the velocities. I breezed through this problem pretty easily, then moved back to #2.

At this point, I was ready to give up. I've tried everything I possibly could. An hour later, turns out my problem was that I only considered single-digit cases, not double digits. Bummer. As soon as I fixed this, it worked.

I had 10 minutes remaining, so I didn't even bother trying #4.

In the end, I got a 769. This was pretty good, considering this was my first programming competition. Although I was pretty bummered out when I heard the cutoff for Silver was 800. If only I had done #4...
